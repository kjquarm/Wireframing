# Wireframing
Wireframing is the skeletal framework of a website or application. In the design process, wireframing provides a clear layout allowing designers to plan how content will be placed to enhance information hierarchy. This framework also guides the design process, allowing designers to focus more on the functionality of visual design elements.


The Key Elements of a Wireframe
1. Layout Structure:
   This is the skeleton of the interface and it sets consistency across screens while speeding up design decisions. A predominant component is the grid and inn website, the 12
   column grid is often used because of its flexibility and halving nature.
2. Navigation:
   Defines how users move through the site. Common components in this element are the Top Navigation Bar and the Hamburger Menu.
3. Content Placement:
   This shows where essential content like texts and images sit in relation to navigation and user flow. This element prioritises structure; grey boxes for images and lines
   or short blocks for text.
5. Functionality:
   Outlines key functionalities and interactions to ensure clarity of intent. This is done to share understanding across designers, devs, and product owners and prevent
   misinterpretation during handoff. Common styles of this are side notes, linked documents, numbered callouts among others.


Types of Wireframes
Low-Fidelity Wireframes: This is a quick simplified sketch of a product structure.This prioritises layout, basic content placement, and the interaction flow from one screen to another. This wireframe makes use of simple shapes like boxes, lines and placeholders to build structure.

High-Fidelity Wireframes:
This is a build up on Low-Fidelity wireframes making it look more like the finished product. With this, realistic content, spacing, icons, and sometimes elements of color or branding are incorporated to show how screens will look, behave, and react to user interactions.

High-fidelity wireframe, since the reference image is close to the final design with realistic typography, colours and spacing.


Figma is a widely recommended tool for wireframes because of its collaborative design platform that allows designers to create low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes in the same environment, making the design process seamless and efficient.
Also, Figma being a browser-based software allows designers, developers and other stakeholders view, comment and update designs in real-time.


Wireframes guide the design process by establishing the basic structure of a product before visual details are added. They show how content is organized, how users navigate, and where key actions take place.
For example, a clear layout grid ensures consistency, and defined navigation elements help stakeholders align on user flow early on. Content placement highlights which information matters most, keeping user goals at the center. Functionality notes and annotations then clarify how interactive components should behave, so developers and stakeholders understand the intent behind every element.


During an e-commerce website redesign, low-fidelity wireframes revealed that users had trouble finding the “Add to Cart” button because it was placed below product images. The team resolved this by repositioning the button prominently next to the image before development began. This early fix improved usability, reduced friction in the shopping process, and avoided costly post-development changes.
Wireframing, therefore, plays a key role in identifying potential issues early, guiding design decisions, and ensuring a user-friendly final product.
