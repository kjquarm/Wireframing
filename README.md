# Wireframing
Wireframing is the skeletal framework of a website or application. In the design process, wireframing provides a clear layout allowing designers to plan how content will be placed to enhance information hierarchy. This framework also guides the design process, allowing designers to focus more on the functionality of visual design elements.
