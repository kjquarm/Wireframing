# Wireframing
Wireframing is the skeletal framework of a website or application. In the design process, wireframing provides a clear layout allowing designers to plan how content will be placed to enhance information hierarchy. This framework also guides the design process, allowing designers to focus more on the functionality of visual design elements.

The Key Elements of a Wireframe
1. Layout Structure:
   This is the skeleton of the interface and it sets consistency across screens while speeding up design decisions. A predominant component is the grid and inn website, the 12
   column grid is often used because of its flexibility and halving nature.
2. Navigation:
   Defines how users move through the site. Common components in this element are the Top Navigation Bar and the Hamburger Menu.
3. Content Placement:
   This shows where essential content like texts and images sit in relation to navigation and user flow. This element prioritises structure; grey boxes for images and lines or
   short blocks for text.
4. Functionality:
   Outlines key functionalities and interactions to ensure clarity of intent. This is done to share understanding across designers, devs, and product owners and prevent
   misinterpretation during handoff. Common styles of this are side notes, linked documents, numbered callouts among others.
